Hey there, I'm Nick and this is my site's source code. This site started off as a clone of the [Netlify CMS Gatsby Starter](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms 'Netlify CMS Gatsby Starter') (check it out!). Since then, I've tweaked it a lot and converted the codebase to TypeScript.

Feel free to peruse the code and/or fork it. ðŸ˜‰

Thanks to all the wonderful projects that made it possible to build this blog.
