So like many, I too will make resolutions for 2018. I made myself accountable by joining a recent [#DevDiscuss on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ThePracticalDev/status/948373905181478913).

So let's break down the list:

1. I've been active in OSS for the past couple of years, with most of my focus being on [react-slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot). I started contributing to this project as a way to learn [React](https://reactjs.org) and at some point, to my surprise, I was asked to become a collaborator on the project. I really enjoy working on this project with my partners in crime.

In 2018, I will keep contributing to OSS including react-slingshot, but specifically I will contribute at least one PR to [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode), [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) and the [Brave Browser](https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop). These are all fantastic projects that I use everyday, so it just makes sense.

2. Keep on blogging <span style="color: green">&#10004;</span> thanks to this post. ðŸ˜‰

3. Start making code pens on [codepen.io](https://codepen.io). I've never made any so yolo, here we go.

4. Read everything I put in [Pocket](https://getpocket.com). This is a toughy, but let's see how it goes.

5. [Functional-Light JavaScript](https://leanpub.com/fljs) is supposed to be a fantastic book. Kyle Simpson is a great teacher and has plenty of books out there, i.e. [YDKJS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS). I'm looking forward to reading this one.

Now it's time to add a reminder in Google Inbox for the end of the year to see if I'm all talk or not. ðŸ˜‰ ðŸ’ª
