This comment in the Jest repository, https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/7554#issuecomment-454358729, has been floating around on the Twitterverse the past few days and seems to be garnering a lot of attention.

The fact that a Facebook project is migrating to [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org) (TS) is kind of big deal considering they're also behind [Flow](https://flowtype.org), a direct competitor of TS.

Other prominent JS devs have been chiming in as well. Some with a little more cursing, so apologies in advance. ðŸ˜‰

Is this the final nail in the coffin for Flow? Is it another year where TypeScript adoption continues to rise and it becomes the Year of TypeScript?

There's even a [horse_ts](https://twitter.com/horse_ts) Twitter account now. It's not too hard to guess who it is, but I still find it pretty funny.

"So if youâ€™ve been a holdout (like me, to be honest), 2019 is definitely the year to learn TypeScript.", [KBall](https://twitter.com/kbal11) quote from https://zendev.com/2019/01/15/frontend-development-topics-to-learn-in-2019.html
