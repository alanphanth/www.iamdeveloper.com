Let's forget frameworks and libraries for a moment. Today weâ€™re just going to talk about the `<form />` element and some of the things you can do with it in the DOM.

For web devs who are getting a little long in the tooth, youâ€™re probably familiar with most of this, but for newer devs, this might be news to you. Either way, buckle up because weâ€™re about to go old school with forms.

With newer DOM APIs like `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll`, we can access forms via a selector, e.g. `document.querySelector(â€˜formâ€™);`. Did you know that you can also access forms directly from the `document`? There is an `HTMLCollections` of forms available via `document.forms`. Go ahead, Iâ€™ll let you open the dev tools in your favourite editor. Pretty neat eh?

So letâ€™s say weâ€™re on [amazon.ca](https://amazon.ca).

You have a form that looks like this:

```html
<form class="nav-searchbar" name="site-search">
...
</form>
```

OK, so you know there is a `document.forms` object. Letâ€™s take a peek in the dev tools.

`document.forms[0]` finds our form, and there is one other form on the page, but thereâ€™s also two more properties on `document.forms`. Thereâ€™s `site-search` and `ue_backdetect`. If we look at the markup above for our form, we see it has a `name` attribute with the value `â€™site-search'`. Thatâ€™s one of the extra properties on `document.forms`. Sure enough, `document.forms[â€˜site-searchâ€™]` gives us a form. If we do `document.forms[0] === document.forms[â€˜site-searchâ€™]` in the console of our dev tools, weâ€™ll see that it returns true.

If you havenâ€™t caught on yet, this means that you can access forms via an index, which represents the order they appear in the DOM, but you can also access it via a formâ€™s `name` attribute.

Alright, thereâ€™s more folks. Letâ€™s get a reference to our form by running the following in the console, `const siteSearchForm = document.forms['site-search']`.

Now letâ€™s see what properties are available on our form.

OK, so we see some properties like `action`, for the URL to `GET`/`POST` to, but as we go down the list, thereâ€™s one called `elements`. Hmm, what could that be? ðŸ˜‰ If we access it in the dev tools console, we get the following:

What? All the form inputs are in there! Thatâ€™s right folks, you have access to all the `<input />`s, `<textarea />`s etc via this property. Pretty cool eh? Not only that, if the form inputs have a `name` attribute, we can do the same thing we did for `document.forms`. We can access the form inputs by index or their name, e.g. `siteSearchForm.elements[â€˜field-keywordsâ€™]`.

So accessing forms and form inputs can be done right off the `document` via the `document.forms` property. Hope you enjoyed this DOM Throwback Thursday.
