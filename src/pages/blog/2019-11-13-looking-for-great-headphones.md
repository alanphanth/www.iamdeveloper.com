I've generally been working with cheap headphones. I currently have a pair of [MPow H7](https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Headphones-Comfortable-Rechargeable-Microphone/dp/B07C48ZYXR) headphones. They're not bad for a non-audiophile, but I am not fooling myself into thinking these are premium noise-cancelling headphones.

I have never considered a high-end set of headphones because I've broken every pair I've ever owned at some point. I'd like to think I'm a little more careful these days with them though, so I think it's time to grab a solid upgrade.

I'm looking for Bluetooth, noise-cancelling, great sound and ideally a great built-in microphone. An optional wired option would be nice as well. Ideally, I would like to spend no more than 350$ USD. It's a chunk of change, but I'm in it for the long haul with whichever headphones I decide on.

I'm going to throw out a couple here that I might consider, but I'd love to hear peoples suggestions as I've only begun my research.

* [Bose QC-35 II](https://www.bose.ca/en_ca/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/quietcomfort-35-wireless-ii.html#v=qc35_ii_rose_gold)
* [Sony WH-1000XM3](https://www.amazon.ca/Sony-WH1000XM3-Canceling-Headphones-WH-1000XM3/dp/B07G4MNFS1)
* [Sennheiser PXC 550](https://www.amazon.ca/Sennheiser-PXC-550-Wireless-Cancelling/dp/B01E3XLNA0/)

I decided to go with the Sony WH-1000XM3.
