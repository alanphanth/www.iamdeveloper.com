In May of 2016, I decided to embark with a fintech startup and live in Barcelona for the summer in a front-end focused developer role using React, TypeScript, Node and other goodies. My bosses and I (future Montreal office) were in Barcelona to learn the business, help get the office in Spain staffed and up and running and then the plan was to return to Montreal to open the Montreal office.

The risk for me was that although I had just over a year of professional TypeScript experience and plenty of JavaScript under the belt, I had no professional experience with React or Node (aside from some build tools) and had only ever had mainly full-stackish roles all in the .NET ecosystem. In the past, when opportunities like this would come around, I would have said to myself, you‚Äôre not what they‚Äôre looking for, but this time I said screw it, go for it.

‚Äú[I dropped .NET a couple of years ago. I had done WebForms, ASP.NET MVC, SharePoint etc. and wen‚Ä¶ ‚Äî DEV](https://dev.to/nickytonline/comment/2ao1)‚Äù

Although I had no professional React experience, I had started to contribute to a pretty popular React/Redux boilerplate called [React Slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot/commits?author=nickytonline) (eventually I was [asked to become a maintainer]([https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot/pull/298#issuecomment-258616537]) and accepted üòâ) to help me learn React along with [Dan Abramov](https://dev.to/dan_abramov)‚Äôs awesome free egghead.io Redux Course. With that under my belt, I took off for Barcelona. I met/worked with a lot of good people, got to head to London a couple of times to visit/work with my UK co-workers and finished off the summer by spending a bit of downtime on the coast of Spain as well as seeing a free (thank you Tourism Andorra) outdoor show of Cirque du Soleil's [Scalada : Vision](https://visitandorra.com/en/agenda/scalada-vision-by-cirque-du-soleil-2016/) in Andorra in the mountains.

During my interviews for my next role, one of the places that stood out was Intel. The role was for a front-end developer to work on their password manager browser extension offering. I had never worked in the browser extension space, so that‚Äôs what got my attention. Interviews went really well and then there was the take home test. The test was to make a rudimentary password manager browser extension.

One of the developers had expressed interest in TypeScript so I decided to take my React, Redux and TypeScript skills and build a browser extension using those technologies. It was a lot of fun to build the extension and I got it working, including hot reloading. You could log in to the big sites, Twitter, Facebook etc. and the extension would save your login/password. If you were logged out and revisited one of those sites, you‚Äôd be automatically logged on. As well, I had made a basic admin page to modify your credentials per domain. When I spoke to my future co-workers, they had said that aside from being competent, it was my take home test that had stood out. 

To sum it up, what I‚Äôve found to be successful career wise these past few years:
* Looking to switch jobs? Don‚Äôt, regardless of how fed up you are, quit before landing another job because there is less pressure during a job hunt when you‚Äôre employed.
* Take chances‚Ä¶ really. You might even get to visit some interesting places.
* Standout.
  * Everyone does the take home test at some point. Make yours standout.
  * Contribute to open-source. (Some will disagree because of work/life balance, but in my experience, it helps set you apart)
  * standout in another way that you think would set you apart from other candidates.
* Even when you leave a job for whatever reason, it‚Äôs still a good experience, because you learnt something from it and you also potentially met some interesting people that down the road, I‚Äôm sure your paths will cross again.
