The only conference I’ve ever attended was [JBCN](https://www.jbcnconf.com/2016/) in 2016 for Java when I worked in Barcelona because my company at the time was a sponsor.‪

I’ve never been to a JavaScript or frontend centric conference before. If you were to pick one to attend, regardless of location and cost, which one would you choose?‬

P.S. I’m also a fan of React, so the conference could be React centric.
