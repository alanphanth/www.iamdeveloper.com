If you want to see the previous Code Pen I did, check out [A Simple ‚≠ê Rating Code Pen](https://www.iamdeveloper.com/blog/2019-10-31-a-simple-%E2%AD%90-rating-code-pen/).

Continuing along with my [2018 Resolutions](https://www.iamdeveloper.com/blog/2018-01-03-2018-resolutions/) to make Code Pens this year, here is my latest.

A fun little poop notification component. Maybe [Squatty Potty](https://www.squattypotty.com) can use it üòÇ (watch their commercial if you're having a bad day).

One of the reasons I wanted to start making Code Pens was to see how much I can do without the help of JS. In this example, Javascript is only used to increment a CSS variable.

The easiest way to work on the hover effect is to use the "force state" feature in Chrome. See it in action at 2:40, the Bonus Tip! part of the What's New in DevTools video on how to work with "force state".

Yes, the poop emoji looks like a pilgrim. That's the best I could do for their hat for now. That's all folks. Now go hover over that üí© notification!
