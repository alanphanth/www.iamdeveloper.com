My new MBP is on its way and I'm wondering what everyone is using these days in regards to a VM for Windows on a Mac.

In the past I've had VMWare Fusion and it seemed decent. I've also been using VirtualBox at work and that seems to have been fine as well.

I'm fine with upgrading my VMWare Fusion or buying Parallels, I'm just wondering what everyone else is running on a Mac these days.
