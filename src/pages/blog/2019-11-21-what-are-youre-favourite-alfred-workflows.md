I mention some that I use in [My Mac Setup](https://www.iamdeveloper.com/blog/2018-01-12-my-mac-setup/). I also have a few I wrote a while back for those interested, [github.com/nickytonline/alfred-workflows](https://github.com/nickytonline/alfred-workflows).

For those of you that use Alfred, what are some of your favourite Alfred workflows? [Join the discussion here](https://dev.to/nickytonline/what-are-you-re-favourite-alfred-workflows-3elm/#comments).
