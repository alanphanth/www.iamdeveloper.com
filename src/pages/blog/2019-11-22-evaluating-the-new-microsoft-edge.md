So a while back I Tweeted that I was going to take the new MS Edge browser for a tour.

So the first thing I did was [grab the Edge Beta](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-ca/) since there is currently no official release yet. I am using a Mac, so all the following applies to Mac usage.

Once installed, I enabled sync by logging in with my Microsoft account. This is pretty standard browser stuff. FireFox and Chrome do this as well. I guess the one caveat is that if you do not have a Microsoft account, you will need to create one if you wish to sync your settings.

So far so good. The next thing was to install all the Chrome extensions that I had installed on Chrome and Brave browser. Once again, this process was fairly easy. The only thing that was required was to allow extensions to be installed from an external source, i.e. the Chrome Web Store.

After a month of usage, I can say that it pretty much behaves as I would expect a Chromium based browser to work. The one thing I do not like, and maybe this is just because it is a beta build for the time being, but having to go through the  Microsoft update application is annoying. I would rather it just auto update like Chrome or Brave does. This is minor, but this is a review. ðŸ˜‰

For mobile, it was pretty easy to find an install in the Apple App Store. I have not tried it on an Android device, but I imagine it's just as easily available from the Google Play Store.

I started to use it daily on my phone. Overall, I did not notice any issues except for one on GitHub. It does not seem able to load contributor graphs or the GitHub feed. I have no idea why and did not take the time to investigate. I am sure this will get sorted, but it is worth a mention. Perhaps other sites have similar issues, but for the life of a software developer, this appeared to be the only site that I experienced this.

The one thing that I do not understand is why they provide a continue browsing later feature on iOS, since the feature clearly states to have the latest version of Windows installed on your PC.
