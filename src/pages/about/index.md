I'm just some dev on the Autodesk [Shotgun](https://www.shotgunsoftware.com) team. I'm a big fan of TypeScript, JavaScript, React and Node. C#/ASP.NET once upon a time. I'm also not a big fan of spiders.

I also love contributing to open source.

* [https://dev.to repository](https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to/commits?author=nickytonline). I was the first developer to contribute to the repo and gained early access while it was still a private repo. Since then I've contributed quite a bit to the codebase, mainly in the frontend.
* [coryhouse/react-slingshot · GitHub](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot/commits?author=nickytonline). I contributed quite a bit to this repository when I started to learn React/Redux and then I was asked and accepted to become a I’m a maintainer of the repository.
* [Converting tota11y to a browser extension](https://github.com/Khan/tota11y/pull/131). This is still not merged but you can still use this PR as an unpacked browser extension.
