I'm just some dev on the Autodesk [Shotgun](https://www.shotgunsoftware.com) team. I'm a big fan of TypeScript, JavaScript, React and Node. C#/ASP.NET once upon a time. I'm also not a big fan of spiders.

I also love contributing to open source. Here are some highlights of my most recent open source work.


* [Helped Migrate the Refined GitHub extension to TypeScript](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github/commits?author=nickytonline)

* [https://dev.to repository](https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to/commits?author=nickytonline). I gained early access to the repository while it was still private and was the first developer to contribute to the repository outside of the core team. Since then I've contributed quite a bit to the codebase, mainly in the frontend. I also cross-post my blog posts to [dev.to](https://dev.to).

* [coryhouse/react-slingshot · GitHub](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot/commits?author=nickytonline). I contributed quite a bit to this repository when I started to learn React/Redux and then I was asked and accepted to become a I’m a maintainer of the repository.
